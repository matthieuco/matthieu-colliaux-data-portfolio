# 🧱 Data Transformation with DBT (BigQuery)

This project uses dbt (data build tool) to transform raw data stored in BigQuery into analytics-ready tables consumed by Power BI.dbt ensures data quality, modular transformations, documentation, and lineage across the entire analytics pipeline.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```text
Raw CSV files
   ↓
BigQuery (raw dataset)
   ↓
dbt (staging → intermediate → marts)
   ↓
BigQuery (analytics dataset)
   ↓
Power BI dashboards 


=> dbt acts as the transformation and semantic layer, enforcing business logic and exposing clean, trusted tables for BI consumption.

## 🔹 Modelling Strategy

Staging models (stg_*)
	•	One-to-one mapping with raw source tables
	•	Column renaming and standardization
	•	Type casting and basic data cleaning
	•	No business logic
Intermediate models (int_*)
	•	Business logic consolidation
	•	Complex joins and transformations
	•	Preparation for analytical use cases
Marts (fact_*, dim_*)
	•	Star-schema inspired modeling
	•	Facts defined at a clear and documented grain
	•	Dimensions designed for BI filtering and slicing
	•	Optimized for Power BI performance and usability

🧪 Data Quality & Testing
Data quality is enforced using dbt tests, including:
	•	not_null
	•	unique
	•	Relationship tests between facts and dimensions
Example:
tests:
  - not_null
  - unique

## 📚 Documentation & Lineage
dbt documentation is generated to provide:
	•	Column-level descriptions
	•	Model-level explanations
	•	Full data lineage across the warehouse

dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve

## 📊 Consumption Layer (Power BI)
Power BI connects exclusively to dbt marts stored in BigQuery:
	•	fact_delivery
	•	dim_sellers
	•	dim_customers
	•	dim_time
This approach guarantees:
	•	Consistent KPIs
	•	Improved query performance
	•	Clear separation between transformation and visualization layers

## 🚀 Why dbt?
Using dbt allows this project to follow analytics engineering best practices:
	•	Version-controlled transformations
	•	Reusable and testable SQL models
	•	Centralized business logic
	•	Scalable architecture
